# Katie-Rose

I'm currently a software engineer in training at Makers Academy! Here i have learnt technical skills across back-end coding languages Python and JavaScript and front-end styling with HTML and CSS, with a focus on learning Object Oriented Programming, debugging skills, Test-driven development, web application development and web application deployment. 

My background is in data analytics, which exposed me to coding languages and then my eagerness for problem solving led me to software enginnering.
