# Katie-Rose

I am currently undergoing software engineering training at Makers Academy, where I've honed technical skills in back-end coding using Python and JavaScript, and front-end styling with HTML and CSS. My focus has been on developing proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming, debugging, Test-driven development, and web application deployment.

With a background in data analytics, I transitioned to software engineering driven by a passion for problem-solving. During this journey, I've actively contributed to team projects such as akersBNB, gaining hands-on experience in Agile methodology.

What excites me most about tech is its dynamic nature, providing the power to shape the future and solve all kinds of problems. The rapid evolution of the industry ensures that there is always something new to learn and explore!
